# northwind_analytics

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks and SQL scripts for performing analytics on the Northwind database, a classic dataset used to represent a retail company's operations (sales, products, employees, etc.). The goal is to derive insights from the data, including sales trends, customer behaviors, and other key performance indicators (KPIs).
